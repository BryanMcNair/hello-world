# hello-world
Hello everyone, I really wanted to learn how to create web sites since home computers first came out to the public back around 1990 I think. My first adventure turned out Daniels Descendants. http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mcnair/
After that I was so busy raising kids and just trying to survive the demands of a thankless job that I lost focus to what I really wanted to do. Throughout the last 3 years I have worked towards a degree through the Arts Institute in web design. Dropped them and began studies with the local community college. And now it looks like I am going to drop them and just go for it. After all I'm not looking for an actual paper certificate. I just want to progressively  learn and do my thing. Programming has become my retirement career.  

Currently Iâ€™m looking into how to utilize Kube.
